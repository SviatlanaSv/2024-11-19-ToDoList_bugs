# ToDo List Web Page Bug Report

This repository contains the results of manual testing conducted on the ToDo List web page ([https://todolist.james.am/#/](https://todolist.james.am#/)) as part of my first testing assignment.

## Testing Overview

- **Manual Testing**: I performed manual testing on the website to identify functionality and user interface issues.
- **Bug Report**: Based on the testing, I created a document detailing the bugs found in both functionality and UI, along with their priority levels.

This project represents my first experience in web testing, focusing on identifying and documenting issues to improve the overall user experience.

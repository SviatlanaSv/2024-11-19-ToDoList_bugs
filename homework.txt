Found bugs on the web page https://todolist.james.am/#/
 
I. FUNCTIONALITY
 
High priority:
 
1. Unable to delete all active tasks with the “Clear” button; only one at a time by clicking the delete icon at the end of each task's linebar.
2.  When all tasks are displayed, the “Clear” button deletes only completed tasks.
3. When only active tasks are displayed, the “Clear” button removes tasks from the “Completed” list.
4. The task counter “<number> items left” shows an incorrect value (one number less).
 
Low priority:
 
1. No marks for edited tasks.
 
 
II. USER INTERFACE
 
Medium priority:
 
1. The “active” button is written with a small letter, compared to the others.
2. The panel for sorting and deleting tasks (at the bottom of the task list) is poorly visible (dull color).
 
Low priority:
 
1. Moving to the sorting and deleting panel is inconvenient when there are a large number of tasks
